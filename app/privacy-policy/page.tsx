                        1. We reserve the right to prevent you from using our Platform, our Customer Service, your Account, or making any Bookings. We also reserve the right to cancel any Bookings you have previously made. Of course, we'll only take this action if we believe there is a compelling basis to do so, such as:
                        <br />
                        - Fraud or abuse
                        <br />

                        - Failure to abide by our values or any applicable rules or legislation

                        2. You won't be eligible for a refund if we have to cancel a Booking as a result. Unless doing so would (a) violate any applicable laws or (b) hinder or prohibit the investigation or prevention of fraud or other criminal acts, we may explain why we had to cancel your Booking. Please get in touch with our Customer Service team if you think your Booking has been wrongly canceled by us.

                    <li>
                        1. We will only be responsible for costs you incur as a direct result of our failure, to the extent permitted by obligatory consumer law. This means that we won't be responsible for anything, for example:
                        <br />
                        - Unintentional loss or damage
                        <br />

                        - A service provider's or another business partner's product, service, or conduct - An error in an email address, phone number, or credit card number (unless it was our error)
                        <br />
                        - A force majeure or unavoidable circumstance.

                    <li>
                        2. To the extent permitted by law, if you violate these Terms and/or the terms of the Service Provider: - We will not be responsible for any costs you incur as a result; - You will not be eligible for a refund.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3. As far as the law will allow, the maximum we or any Service Provider will be responsible for (whether for a single event or a string of related events) is the amount of your Booking, as stated in your confirmation email.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4. These conditions do not restrict our (or the Service Provider's) responsibility for either (i) carelessness that results in a death or personal injury or (ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

                    <li>
                        5. Other than what is specifically stated in these Terms, we don't provide any guarantees about the goods and services offered by Service Providers. You alone are responsible for making the best decision(s).

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        7. Mandatory consumer protection laws and regulations may shield you from harm and grant you rights that no contract you sign with a firm may revoke. In that situation, in addition to these Terms, any applicable consumer protection laws and regulations also govern our liability.

                        <li>
                            1. Some Service Providers mention a "damage policy" when you make a reservation. Accordingly, if someone in your organization misplaces or harms anything:
                            The Service Provider should be notified. The Service Provider will have 14 days to submit a damage payment request through our Platform, under your reservation number. If they do, we'll let you know so you can let us know if you have any questions or concerns and whether you agree with the charge. Next:
                            If you accept, we'll bill you on their behalf. If not, we'll investigate and decide whether or not to continue the conversation.
                            <br />
                            2. The maximum amount the Service Provider may charge you under the damage coverage through our Platform has a cap.
                            <br />
                            3. We would merely be organizing the payment on the Service Provider's behalf; any payment you make would be between the Service Provider and you.
                            <br />
                            4. The damage policy does not apply to routine cleaning, normal wear and tear, any crimes (such as theft), or any 'damages' that are not actually physical (such as fines for smoking or bringing pets).
                            <br />
                            5. Prior to or at check-in, the service provider may request a "damage deposit." The 'damage policy' has nothing to do with it, but if they do, we'll let you know about it when you make your reservation. No financial settlement involving damage deposits will include us. In the event that there is any damage, the Service Provider may choose to file a (legal) claim against you independent of the damage policy, in which case the limit (see number five above) would not be applicable.

                            <br />
                            3. In the majority of circumstances, you will receive your booking confirmation as soon as you make your booking; however, if the service provider does not confirm your rental right away, we will wait to accept payment and send you your booking confirmation.
                            <br />
                            4. The Rental Agreement will take precedence over these Terms if there is any inconsistency.

                        <li>
                            1. Unless we specifically state otherwise, we cannot guarantee the actual make and model you are reserving. 'Or similar' denotes that you might be able to find an automobile that is comparable (i.e., the same size, with the same type of gearbox, etc.). Therefore, the car images are solely for illustration.
                            <br />
                            2. Following the completion of your rental, we will provide the Service Provider with the booking information (such as the name and phone number of the Main Driver).
                            - We'll give you pick-up specifics, such as the service provider's contact information and a list of items you need to bring.

                        </li>
                    </ol>

                        <li>
                            1. You must give us all the facts we require to set up your Booking (contact information, pickup time, etc.).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            2. You must read and accept these Terms and the Rental Agreement, and you recognize that if you do, the following will happen:
                            <br />
                            - You could be required to make extra payments.
                            <br />
                            - Your reservation could be canceled, and
                            <br />
                            - The rental counter employees could refuse to give you the keys.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            3. As many elements (such as required driving licenses, security deposit amounts, required documents, approved forms of payment, etc.) differ from Rental to Rental, it is important to confirm the criteria for your particular Rental. So make sure you read this carefully:
                            <br />
                            - These Terms
                            <br />
                            - The essential clauses of the rental agreement that you can see while making a reservation
                            <br />
                            - The Rental Agreement itself that you get during pick-up.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            4. If you are late, the car may no longer be available, and you won't be eligible for a refund. You must arrive at the rental counter by the time designated for pick-up. Even if there is a flight delay and you have given your flight number, it is imperative that you get in touch with the Service Provider or us if you believe you could be running late.
                            <br /><br />
                            5. Your Rental's important terms outline the requirements for the primary driver during pick-up. You must make sure they have everything they need when they arrive at the rental counter, such as a driver's license, any necessary identification, and a credit card in their own name with enough available credit to cover the security deposit.
                            <br /><br />
                            6. Ensure that the primary driver is qualified and fit (in the Service Provider's opinion) to operate the vehicle.
                            <br /><br />
                            7. At pick-up, you must have all the required documentation (such as identification, a voucher, and a driver's license).
                            <br /><br />
                            8. You must present the counter personnel with a full, current driver's license for each driver, which they must have had for at least a year (and, in many circumstances, longer). Please inform us as quickly as possible if any drivers have license endorsements or points because the Service Provider might not let them operate a vehicle.

                                1. If you return the car to a different location, the Service Provider will frequently impose a one-way fee. If you plan to do this, you must indicate the drop-off location when making your reservation so that we can let you know if it is possible and provide information on any one-way fees, which you would pay at pick-up.
                                <br />
                                2. The Service Provider frequently levies a cross-border cost for transporting the vehicle to another nation, state, or island. It is crucial that you notify us and/or the Service Provider as soon as possible if you want to do this (it must be prior to pick-up).
                                <br />
                                3. Your rental fee is computed in 24-hour increments, thus, for example, a 25-hour rental will cost the same as a 48-hour rental.
                                <br />
                                4. Please get in touch if you decide that you want to retain the automobile longer after Pick-Up. You will engage into a new contract once evaluated and you will be provided with an estimate of the cost. If you return the car after hours without getting permission in advance, they could also charge you a late fee.

                                1. In some circumstances, you can pay for any extras up front (such as child seats, GPS units, winter tires, etc.) and be sure to have them at pick-up.
                                <br />
                                2. In other instances, you may only request any extras when reserving your automobile; in this case, you'll pay for them at pick-up and the Service Provider makes no guarantees that they'll be offered to you.

                        <li>
                            1. We go beyond what is required by law. Although local laws do not force us to provide particular cancellation rights, we promise that if you cancel your Booking, we will follow our returns policy.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            2. Before you are scheduled to pick up the automobile, you can make modifications to your booking at any moment.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            3. Typically, using our website's 'Manage Booking' section or our app is the simplest way to do this.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            4. You can make modifications to your reservation without paying an administration fee, but the cost of the rental may alter. We may have to cancel a Booking in some cases in order to make changes, in which case the rental business may charge you a cancellation fee.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            5. We will notify you in advance if making changes to your Booking might result in a pricing change or a cancellation fee.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            6. The 'Cancellation and Amendments' listed below All reservations are subject to the following terms:
                            <br />
                            - Reservations made with Dollar or Thrifty before to January 26, 2021 (please review your rental rules).

                            - "Non-refundable" reservations (you cannot change a non-refundable reservation, and you won't get a refund if you cancel it).

                        <li>
                            1. You will receive a full refund if you cancel: MORE THAN 7 days before your rental is scheduled to begin.
                            Less than 7 days in advance or while you are still at the rental counter, we will return your payment less the cost of the first three days of your rental; if your automobile was reserved for three days or fewer, there will be no refund.
                            You won't get a refund AFTER your rental is scheduled to begin (or if you just fail to show up).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            2. The counter staff may deny you the automobile if (for instance):
                            <br />
                            - You are late;
                            <br />
                            - You are ineligible to rent the car;

                            - You lack the required papers;
                            <br />
                            - The primary driver lacks a credit card in their own name
                            <br />with sufficient accessible money to cover the security deposit for the car.
                            If that occurs, kindly call us from the rental counter to cancel your Booking; you will then be issued a refund less the cost of the first three days of your rental. If not, you won't be eligible for a refund.

No matter how near to the start of your Rental is, you will be able to cancel and receive a full refund if you don't agree to the modification.

                            1. Some airlines have 'code share' arrangements with other airlines. Your "ticketing carrier" may be one airline, but your "operating carrier" may be another airline that owns the aircraft you fly in. In most situations like these, you will check in with your operating carrier; nevertheless, if possible, please confirm this in advance with your ticketing carrier.
                            <br />
                            2. You will be informed if your flight is a "code share" flight when you book it.

                                1. The majority of airlines don't let customers purchase tickets that contain flights they don't want to take, such a round-trip ticket if they don't want to take the return flight. Simply type "point-beyond ticketing," "hidden-city ticketing," or "back-to-back ticketing" into a search engine to find further examples.
                                <br />
                                2. By purchasing a Flight, you promise not to do this and to hold us harmless from any airline claims for the price difference between your actual trip and the full trip price listed on your ticket(s).

                                1. Most airlines demand that passengers use their flights in the correct order. Therefore, your airline can automatically cancel the rest of your schedule if you miss your initial flight.
                                <br />
                                2. Please make sure to cancel the flight(s) you don't want in accordance with the airline's cancellation policy if your airline does enable you to "skip" any flights on your schedule. Be aware that you might not be eligible for a refund at all (or even a partial refund) for some untaken flights.

                                1. If you purchase two one-way tickets instead of one round-trip ticket, you will be creating two separate bookings with their own rules and policies. Any changes to one Flight will not affect the other (for instance, if your first Flight is canceled, you won't be guaranteed a refund for your second Flight).

                                3. Although 'disinfection' of aircraft to kill insects is not a common practice, it is permitted by international law. In order to accomplish this, staff may either spray an aerosol pesticide into the cabin of the aircraft while passengers are inside or treat its interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while they are outside. We urge you to research disinfection beforehand, including potential locations.
